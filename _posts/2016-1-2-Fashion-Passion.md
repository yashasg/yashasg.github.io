**Post-Mortem**

_1st Week_:The first week was pretty much discussing different ideas for a serious game, and I
contributed on the idea of everyone coming up with game pitches based on the barf bag.
We started developing the game immediately, because we already had some experience
with Unity mobile, with our last project. Initially we were thinking of a mechanic of cutting a
cloth in our simulator, but then we realized that this will take too long so we iterated
successfully. Gladly we were able to keep the interface very similar to our Avatar MD app,
we had got very familiar with the process. By the end of first week we had a working game,
but just few scripts and animations remaining.

_2nd Week_In the second week, we had the game ready on Monday, there were some art
assets that were yet to be placed in the game. And by Wednesday 7 pm we had the game
ready for dry runs
