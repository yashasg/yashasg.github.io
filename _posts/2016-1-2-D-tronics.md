**Post-Mortem**

_1st Week_:In the first week we decided on the kind of game we wanted to make based of our
previous prototype,Motor Mania,a game which I previously worked on was selected.We
decided that what we wanted from our audiences was the “WOW” factor,when they see our
games,so we decided to make a game with rich particle effects and amazing gameplay.
_2nd Week_:In the second week, we had to show what we had worked on so far,I pulled in a
car mesh from one of unreal tutorials and put it in the game.It worked great,except we
wanted the car to stick to the walls and drive on walls as well which was not possible with a
sedan(the front bumper hit the wall before the tyres touched them),so we had to make a
car that looked more futuristic.

_Week 3_:In this week we got a futuristic car from our artist and I put it in,Our level was
making progress but we had trouble with colliers on mesh that we imported from
maya.Hence we had to test every mesh each time and re-do it every time something went
wrong.This took a lot of time.

_Week 4_:we had our game complete,there was some polishing left like
including Comcast our sponsor which I think we did really well,Kudos to Bob and Sydnie for
the idea.
