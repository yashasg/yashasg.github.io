**Post-Mortem**

_1st Week-Pitching ideas and setting up the initial build (without physics)_
I pitched in the idea of bumping vehicles and pushing them off the screen. The game started off with a
space theme. But soon we decided to move on to a Lava based theme. This didn’t change the underlying
physics of the game, so I didn’t have any problem, but our artist Jared had to change a few sprites. In the
first week I put in some art content and moving bodies in the game. Just to see how it works, and the
team liked the idea.

_2nd Week-Setting up Car physics._
This part was harder than I thought. I found a tutorial to setup car physics and followed it for a long
time, but it didn’t work out in the end. I wasted a good 8 hours on setting up the dll’s for the tutorials, all
in vain. I started playing with some physics objects and somehow got the physics in the game. The car
moved, but not like a car. It took some over time to set things up, but by the beginning of 3rd week we
had a good working physics model of a car. Without collisions!

_3rd week-Setting up the destructible environment._
By middle of the 3rd week I got car and environment collisions figured out and by now we had to hurry
because the final presentation was in 1 week. I dropped all the overreaching features like making cars
jump etc. I quickly started working on enhancing what we have. Like sparks when cars collide and an
explosion when the car falls off the table. I also included the music and the sound effects for the game.

_4th week-Bug fixes and final presentation video._
On the 4th week. I had to make an end state for the game. For the most part I added a timer to the
screen, as soon as the players run out of time, the game ends with a draw. Along with this, me and
Mitch worked on the video and the presentation.
