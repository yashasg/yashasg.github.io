**Post-Mortem**

_1st Week_:The first week was pretty much discussing different ideas for a serious game, and learning
Javascript. My co engineer started on the development of the game,as he was familiar with Unity, Initially we considered our game to
be an obesity simulator, but on speaking to our experts they guided us towards pill compliance for sick
children, narrowing down even more we decided on Children with ADHD as our target audience. Gladly
we were able to keep the interface very similar to our obesity app, so nothing changed in terms of
engineering. We were happy with the outcome of the brainstorming. And speaking to the expert helped
a lot. By the end of first week we had a working game, but just few scripts and animations remaining.

_2nd Week_:In the second week, We put in the animations for the game, and also the pill timer. We were now able to create new pills and place them on the panel. I worked on fixing the
timer and the animations. I also created the panels that held the accessories.
